>> Update the Front Page Gallery <<
===================================

In <index.html>, navigate to the "Recent News" section. The 3-pane window gallery should be near the top of this section. It is within the accordion div.

- Change the contents within each list tag to update the gallery. There is a header and description. The order follows top-to-bottom on the code and left-to-right on the webpage. Use breaks </br> for the text if it becomes too long on one line.

In <style.css>, navigate to the bottom of the script in the "About Me Gallery" section. This section is filled with accordion classes which correspond to the accordion class in <index.html>. There are 3 lines which use a background image.

- Change the url path to update the gallery background pictures. The order follows top-to-bottom on the code and left-to-right on the webpage.
